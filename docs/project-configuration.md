# Project Configuration

The project is bootstrapped using the `npx create-next-app@latest` which is the main way to create a NextJS application. The configured and used tools in this repo are this:

### ESLint

ESLint is a linting tool for JavaScript. By providing specific configuration defined in the `.eslintrc.json` file it prevents developers from making silly mistakes in their code and enforces consistency in the codebase.

### Prettier

This is a great tool for formatting code. It enforces a consistent code style across your entire codebase. By utilizing the "format on save" feature in your IDE you can automatically format the code based on the configuration provided in the `.prettierrc` file. It will also give you good feedback when something is wrong with the code. If the auto-format doesn't work, something is wrong with the code.
